        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a second year in Computer Science. I inspire to be like the hackers in animes and mangas, which is my main source of motivation. I recently moved to a new house with my brother and mother. At the moment, I am still studying to get my degree, but hopefully I get it without much trouble. In hope of getting good at coding, I want to start my own project, but haven't really figured out what to do yet. The only languages I know for now are Python and Javascript. I don't know if I can make a decent indie game with the knowledge I have on me right now, but if I work hard on it one step at a time, I want to make a platform game to challenge my brother in. My dream is to support my brother in the coding aspect of his biomedical engineering. While he put his efferts into engineering, I will be there to help him with the coding. If he doesn't need me I will do my first choice and that is to find a small company and help that company become more popular. Even if I can't do that alone, I want to make a team that can make that happen. I aim to be the main character of my life that worked hard and live a fulfilling life.</p>
